# lambdamoo
This is simply a copy of the LambdaMOO 1.8.1 source, with some slightly
modified debian package building rules script (better init script, etc).

Created on a whim when I was testing something -- not ready for prod use
unless you're willing to scour/test this all. It was simply better than
what existed in the original old debian woody package, which we shall not
speak of.
