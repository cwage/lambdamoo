lambdamoo (1.8.0r5-9) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Provide full path to start-stop-daemon since user deamon does not have
    it in its path. This bug prevents lambdamoo from starting and the fix
    is trivial so I'd like to get it into frozen.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Tue,  5 Jan 1999 14:03:38 -0800

lambdamoo (1.8.0r5-8) frozen unstable; urgency=medium

lambdamoo (1.8.0p6-8) unstable; urgency=high

  * Fix permissions of core database files in /var/lib/lambdamoo/ so they
    cannot be read by others. (Before, it was possible to get wizard on the
    moo by loading up a core file in emergency mode.)
  * Added man page for lambdamoo (#13512).
  * Use debhelper.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Tue, 30 Sep 1997 18:31:09 -0400

lambdamoo (1.8.0p6-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Replaced debstd generated server start and stop scripts with
    hand-written scripts that only stop it if it is actually running.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Fri, 19 Sep 1997 12:20:29 -0400

  * Fixed #12580, unchecked prompting in postinst.
  * Use lambdamoo-core, lambdamoo-server virtual packages.
  * Changed how lambdamoo determines which database to use: lambdamoo-core
    packages now will use update-alternatives to provide 
    /var/lib/lambdamoo/moo.db . Added README.debian explaining this.

  * Use -l in init script to make lambdamoo output to log file.
  * Run lambdamoo as user daemon.
  * Routine update of debian/rules:
    Added build to .PHONY

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Fri, 13 Jun 1997 12:55:40 -0400

lambdamoo (1.8.0p6-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * I've decided to enable OUTBOUND_NETWORK by default. If people think this
    poses too great a security risk, please let me know.
  * According to policy manual, I should remove logfiles on a purge. Do so.
  * Got rid of the startmoo program.
  * Fixed a race condition in the init script.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Mon,  9 Jun 1997 20:37:59 -0400

lambdamoo (1.8.0p6-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Lambdamoo no longer starts the minimal database by default. The minimal
    database is still included in the package, but only as a file in
    /usr/doc/lambdamoo/examples. I anticipate that very few people will ever
    want to use the minimal database. If there is any interest, I will
    consider splitting it out into a seperate package.
  * Added some code to the postinst to clean up minimal database files left
    behind by old versions of the package.
  * Lambdamoo no longer starts when it is installed, unless you have
    lambdacore or some other lambdamoo db already installed.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Thu, 15 May 1997 02:12:27 -0400

lambdamoo (1.8.0p6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Corrected some dependancies:
  	* Only suggest tf, don't recommend it.
  	* Suggest lambdamoo-docs.
  * Fixed a problem that prevented the program from being stopped by
    /etc/init.d/lambdamoo after an upgrade.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Wed, 14 May 1997 15:48:38 -0400

  * Exploit a few debstd features (init script, upstream changelog
    detection, cron jobs)
  * Added restart command to init script.
  * Made init script nearly comply with the standard for output messages.
    (Only nearly becuase I output dots for progress when this monster daemon
    is shutting down.)
  * Added init script, cron script to conffiles
  * Update maintainer's email address.
  * Remove backup copies of minimal.db on purge.
  * Routine update of debian/rules:
