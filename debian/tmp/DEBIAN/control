Description: a server for an online multiuser virtual world
 Lambdamoo is a server for a virtual world, a computer program which users
 can log into and explore. Each user takes control of a computerized
 persona/avatar/incarnation/character. You can walk around, chat with other
 people, solve puzzles, and even create your very own rooms, descriptions
 and items.
 .
 Advanced users can program Lambdamoo, via its built in object-oriented
 programming language.
 .
 Lambdamoo only provides the bare framework for your virtual world. A
 lambdamoo guru could theoretically start with lambdamoo and the included
 minimal core database and work their way up to a full-fledged system. The
 rest of us will want to install the lambdacore or jhcore packages which
 add objects and functionality to lambdamoo.
